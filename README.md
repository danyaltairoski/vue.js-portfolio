# portfolio

My portfolio website, designed in Figma and implemented using Vue.js, reflects my passion for design and coding. Integrating responsiveness, transitions, and routing within Vue.js was a challenge, but overall, crafting this website deepened my Vue.js proficiency and honed my design skills. I learned to harmonize aesthetics and functionality seamlessly.
